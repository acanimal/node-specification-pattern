# Specification pattern for NodeJS

Specification pattern implementation for NodeJS. Suitable for any kind of validations, simplifying, improving reusability and and making code clearer.

Although the [specification pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern) is mainly use in [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) to check business rules, I the idea of combine rules offers great flexibility.

This is a JavaScript implementation of the pattern, both synchronous and asynchronous version, so you can create your custom validation rules and combine them easily into a new rule.
